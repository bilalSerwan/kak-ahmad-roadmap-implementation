# kak-ahmad-roadmap-implementation

[Android Roadmap](https://roadmap.sh/r/android-development-k9lx4)

> **Note: Please follow these steps for any implementation:**
> - Create a new branch.
> - Make a new pull request.
> - Assign @Al-Taie as the reviewer.
> - Do not merge the pull request.
>
> **You do not need to create a new application each time. Instead, create a single application and use different branches for each implementation.**
